   - Ready to generate first migration

FEATURES COMPLETED FROM feature_list.json:
------------------------------------------
None marked as passing yet - foundation work complete, ready to implement features.

CURRENT STATE:
--------------
- Git repository initialized with 2 commits
- Backend structure complete with all database models
- iOS structure documented and ready for Xcode project
- Alembic configured for migrations
- All 56 features documented and ready to implement

NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
-----------------------------
1. Run init.sh to set up development environment
2. Generate and run Alembic migration to create database tables
3. Test backend starts successfully (./start-backend.sh)
4. Create Xcode project following ios/README.md instructions
5. Begin implementing features in priority order from feature_list.json:
   - Start with: "Backend initialization: Set up FastAPI project structure with basic health check"
   - Then: Auth endpoints (register, login, refresh)
   - Then: User profile endpoints
   - Then: Exercise library seed data
   - Continue through list systematically

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- All database models are complete and follow spec exactly
- Models use UUID primary keys (as strings)
- Enums defined for training experience, weight units, e1RM formulas, PR types
- Relationships properly configured with cascade deletes
- DateTime fields use UTC timestamps
- Weight always stored in pounds for consistency (converted for display)
- Sync tracking included (synced_at timestamps)

10. ✅ Created NEXT_STEPS.md
   - Comprehensive guide for future agents
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Implementation order and tips
   - Testing guidelines
   - Git workflow recommendations

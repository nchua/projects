3. ✅ Started FastAPI backend server successfully
   - Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
   - Fixed module import issues by setting correct working directory
   - Health check endpoint responding correctly
   - Root endpoint returning API information

4. ✅ Generated and applied initial database migration
   - Created migration: 41fc1e5fb394_initial_migration.py
   - Applied migration successfully
   - Database file created: backend/fitness_app.db (143 KB)
   - All tables created with proper indexes:
     * users (with email index)
     * user_profiles
     * exercises (with name and canonical_id indexes)
     * workout_sessions (with user_id and date indexes)
     * workout_exercises (with session_id and exercise_id indexes)
     * sets (with workout_exercise_id index)
     * bodyweight_entries (with user_id and date indexes)
     * prs (with user_id, exercise_id, and achieved_at indexes)

5. ✅ Created and ran exercise seed data
   - seed_exercises.py with 55 unique exercises
   - 139 total exercise entries (including aliases)
   - Categories:
     * Push: 18 exercises (bench press, overhead press, dips, etc.)

- Canonical ID system allows grouping of exercise aliases

NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
-----------------------------
1. Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, refresh)

   - POST /auth/login with JWT token generation
   - POST /auth/refresh for token refresh
   - Add JWT middleware for protected routes

2. Implement user profile endpoints
   - GET /profile (protected)
   - PUT /profile (protected)
   - Include bodyweight, age, sex, training experience, preferences

3. Implement exercise endpoints
   - GET /exercises (list all with filtering/search)

   - GET /exercises/{id}

4. Implement workout endpoints
   - POST /workouts (create workout session)
   - GET /workouts (list user's workouts)

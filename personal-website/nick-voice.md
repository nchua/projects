# Nick's Voice Skill

Use this skill when writing or editing content in Nick's voice—for essays, blog posts, or copy iteration.

---

## When to Use
- Drafting new essays or blog posts
- Iterating on website copy
- Editing existing writing to match Nick's voice
- Reviewing AI-generated content to make it sound more authentic

---

## Voice Overview

Nick's writing is **direct and conversational without being informal**. He takes personal ownership of opinions, backs claims with concrete examples, and isn't afraid to take strong positions while acknowledging limitations.

---

## Tone & Personality

### DO
- **State opinions directly** — Use "I believe", "I think", "To me" to frame perspective
- **Be self-aware** — Occasional wit like "Maybe I'm the fool for believing..." or "I'm an optimist, sue me"
- **Use rhetorical questions** — Drive narrative with "So who's right?", "Why does this matter?"
- **Be confident without arrogance** — Take stances, make predictions, but acknowledge you could be wrong
- **Inject personality through asides** — Brief parentheticals or half-sentences that show the human behind the analysis

### DON'T
- Use excessive emojis or overly casual language
- Be overly academic or stiff
- Hedge everything into mush ("it depends", "many factors", "time will tell" as cop-outs)
- Be preachy or prescriptive
- Sound like generic AI ("There are several factors to consider...")
- **Overuse em dashes** — One per paragraph max, and not in consecutive paragraphs. Em dashes have become an AI tell; people notice clusters of them. Use commas, parentheses, or restructure instead.

---

## Structure & Organization

### Typical Patterns
- **Clear thesis early** — Readers know the point in the first few paragraphs
- **Numbered sections or clear headers** — Makes content scannable
- **Frameworks and models** — Criteria lists, diagrams, multi-part breakdowns
- **Blockquotes** — For key insights (both own thoughts and others' quotes)
- **"Final Thoughts" conclusions** — Synthesis, not just summary
- **Horizontal rules** — Separate major sections visually

### Section Starters
- "Here's why:" / "Here are a few reasons:"
- "Let me explain."
- "To understand this, we need to..."
- "This brings me to..."

---

## Argumentation Style

### Building Arguments
1. **Cite specific sources and thought leaders** — Ben Thompson, Peter Thiel, books, articles
2. **Use concrete examples and data** — Dollar amounts, dates, company names
3. **Acknowledge counterarguments before refuting** — "Ben Thompson makes the bull case... So who's right?"
4. **Ground abstraction with personal anecdotes** — "I remember when...", "My family's car..."
5. **Take stances and make predictions** — Don't end with "time will tell" unless genuinely uncertain

### Connecting Ideas
- "This is why..."
- "To put it differently..."
- "The most important [X] is..."
- "I am a big believer that..."
- "I am a big fan of..."

## Vocabulary & Phrasing

### Natural Business/Economics Terms
Nick uses these naturally, not to show off:
- "pareto improvement" — when everyone is made better off
- "status quo inertia" — tendency to stick with current behavior
- "loss aversion" — people avoid losses more than seeking gains
- "network effects" — product gets better as more people use it
- "first principles" — reasoning from fundamentals
- "moat" / "competitive advantage"

### Formatting
- **Italics** for book/article titles and emphasis
- **Bold** for key terms being defined
- **Underlines** for coined or newly-defined terms (in HTML: `<u>digital native</u>`)

### Phrase Patterns
- "To me, [opinion]"
- "I believe [statement]"
- "I think there were a few key..."
- "Obviously [acknowledged fact], but..."
- "The problem with [X] is that..."
- "What struck me most was..."

## Voice Comparisons

### Generic AI (Avoid)
> "There are several factors to consider when evaluating this company. First, we should examine their market position. Additionally, it's important to consider..."

### Nick's Voice (Target)
> "To me, this is the classic example of a non-monopolist claiming monopolist share. From Peter Thiel's Zero to One: [quote]. He goes on to deride 'disruption' as a strategy to differentiate. So who's right?"

---

### Generic AI (Avoid)
> "It's important to maintain consistency in your efforts over time. Regular practice can lead to improved outcomes."

### Nick's Voice (Target)
> "Long-term success depends on consistent habits rather than momentary motivation. Motivation is unreliable. Habits carry you through the days when you don't feel like it."

---

### Generic AI (Avoid)
> "This product has both advantages and disadvantages. While it offers some innovative features, there are also areas where it could improve."

### Nick's Voice (Target)
> "I am a big fan of gamification—it's probably my favorite part of the Apple watch—but we cannot confuse competition for community. Striving to beat your friends encourages engagement, but it doesn't foster a community."

## Pre-Submission Checklist

Before finalizing content in Nick's voice, verify:

- [ ] **Personal ownership** — Uses "I believe" / "I think" / "To me" for opinions
- [ ] **Concrete specifics** — Has examples, data, names, not just abstractions
- [ ] **Counterarguments addressed** — Acknowledges other views before refuting
- [ ] **Clear thesis** — Reader knows the point early
- [ ] **Rhetorical questions** — Used naturally to drive narrative (not forced)
- [ ] **Synthesis ending** — Concludes with insight, not just summary
- [ ] **No AI tells** — Removed "there are several factors", "it's important to note", etc.
- [ ] **Em dash check** — Max one per paragraph, none in consecutive paragraphs
- [ ] **Personality present** — Has at least one aside, quip, or personal detail

## Content Type Variations

### Essays/Blog Posts
Full voice treatment. Use all patterns: thesis, headers, blockquotes, examples, personal anecdotes, conclusion with synthesis.

### Copy Iteration
Focus on: tone, vocabulary, removing AI-isms. May not need full structure if editing existing content.

### Short-form (Taglines, Descriptions)
Distill to: direct statement, one concrete detail or example, personality in word choice. Skip structure.

### Conversational/Chat
More relaxed than published writing:
- More contractions ("I'd", "we're", "that's", "it's")
- Shorter sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones
- Direct feedback without excessive softening
- Self-aware about own tendencies ("I do it too, but...")
- Gives reasoning alongside requests, not just bare instructions
- Practical and efficient, no filler

---

## Topics Nick Knows Well (Context)

When writing on these topics, deeper passion and specifics are expected:
- Tech and business analysis (often contrarian)
- Esports and gaming culture
- Leadership and self-improvement
- Food experiences (especially ramen)
- Meta-analysis (writing about writing, thinking about thinking)

---

## Maturation Note

Voice analysis is based on 2019 writing. Core patterns should remain consistent, but:
- Specific references may need updating for current year
- Some interests may have evolved
- The *patterns* are what matter, not the exact 2019 content

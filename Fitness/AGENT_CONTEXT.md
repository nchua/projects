	•	Relative strength: ~1.63× BW
	•	Classification: Late intermediate, approaching advanced
	•	Percentile:
	•	General population: ~90–93%
	•	Gym-goers: ~65–75%
	•	Strength-focused lifters: ~40–50%

Bench Press

Barbell Row
	•	Working sets: 135 × 8 × 4 (with room to progress)
	•	Estimated 1RM: ~170 lb
	•	Relative strength: ~1.02× BW
	•	Classification: High intermediate / near advanced
	•	Horizontal pulling is a strength, not a weakness

Barbell Curl
	•	Working sets: 65 × 8 × 4
	•	Estimated 1RM: ~82 lb
	•	Relative strength: ~0.49× BW
	•	Classification: High intermediate, near advanced
	•	Arm strength is not a limiting factor

Pull-ups
	•	6–7 strict reps (dead hang, clean)
	•	Classification: Early–mid intermediate
	•	Percentile:
	•	General population: ~65–75%
	•	Strength-focused lifters: ~20–30%
	•	Pull-ups lag relative to squat, row, and curl strength

⸻

Key imbalance identified

Vertical pulling is lagging despite strong horizontal pulling and arm strength.

Root cause is not lats or biceps, but grip endurance under bodyweight / high-intensity load.

⸻

Grip assessment (critical insight)
	•	Never used straps
	•	Never trained grip directly
	•	Fails deadlifts and pull-ups due to grip before prime movers
	•	Cannot currently double-overhand deadlift working weight
	•	BUT can double-overhand RDLs at meaningful load and volume

Grip capability evidence
	•	RDL DOH: 155 × 5 × 5
	•	Indicates solid baseline grip strength
	•	Limitation is peak endurance under maximal friction, not raw grip weakness

Conclusion:

Grip is underexposed, not weak. This is a high-ROI, low-volume fix.

⸻

Training implications (agent logic)
	•	Squat is not the priority limiter
	•	Bench is a secondary opportunity area
	•	Pull-ups and deadlift performance are being artificially capped by grip
	•	Horizontal pulling strength already exceeds vertical pulling ability
	•	Improving grip should:
	•	Raise pull-ups by ~2–3 reps in 4–6 weeks
	•	Increase deadlift confidence and ceiling
	•	Improve upper-body balance and shoulder stability

⸻

Recommended grip strategy (minimal, sustainable)
	•	Keep main lifts unchanged
	•	Add grip work after main lifts
	•	Emphasize:
	•	Dead hangs (submaximal)
	•	Double-overhand RDLs
	•	Sub-deadlift bar holds
	•	Avoid grip-to-failure
	•	Expect fast adaptation (weeks, not months)

⸻

Agent design implications

The agent should:
	•	Normalize lifts by bodyweight
	•	Detect pattern-specific weaknesses (e.g., vertical vs horizontal pull)
	•	Identify grip-limited failure signals
	•	Avoid over-weighting isolation lifts (e.g., curls)
	•	Track:
	•	e1RM trends
	•	Rep PRs
	•	Relative strength ratios
	•	Grip exposure vs grip-limited outcomes
	•	Generate conservative, evidence-based recommendations
